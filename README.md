# Why I develop this game?
 As this game is came from a variety show, it is simple and unpredictable at first.<br>
 Thus, in the show, it include balloons which will be poped if guest right.

# How to play?
 Players should keep avoid guest right number at first.<br>
 If someone guest right, he/she will be "punished" that maybe eat spicy food (or you can add mustard or wasabi if sushi) from origional.
